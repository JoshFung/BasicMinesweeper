TO DO:
- FLAG FEATURE -> p2

    - if multiple tiles beside it have no bombs around it, reveal them all
    - optional -> don't know if it's worth it...
- ERROR CHECKING -> p2
    - impossible tile
    - revealed tile / already flagged -> DONE
- MAIN GAME CYCLE -> p1
    - pick tile
    - reveal tile
        - bomb or continue
- END GAME CHECK -> p1
    - see if all bombs have been picked after each tile reveal
