valueBoard values for each tile:
-1 = Unexposed Blank
-2 = Exposed Blank (no nearby mines)
-3 = Unexposed Mine
-4 = Exposed Mine
-5 = Flag

0-8 = # of mines surrounding the chosen tile

visualBoard values for each tile:
-1 = Unexposed
1 = Exposed


TO DO:
- FLAG FEATURE
    - if already flagged, unflagged
    - visualBoard should have its own marking -> F
- REVEALING BUNCHES
    - if multiple tiles beside it have no bombs around it, reveal them all
    - optional -> don't know if it's worth it...
