valueBoard values for each tile:
-1 = Blank (no numbers)
-2 = Mine
0-8 = # of mines surrounding the chosen tile

visualBoard values for each tile:
-1 = Unexposed w/ nearby bombs or no bombs / Unexposed Mine
-2 = Exposed Mine
-3 = Exposed Blank (no nearby mines)
-4 = Flag
-5 = 
-6 = 
0-8 = # of mines surrounding the chosen tile


TO DO:
- FLAG FEATURE
    - if already flagged, unflagged
    - visualBoard should have its own marking -> F
- REVEALING BUNCHES
    - if multiple tiles beside it have no bombs around it, reveal them all
    - optional -> don't know if it's worth it...
